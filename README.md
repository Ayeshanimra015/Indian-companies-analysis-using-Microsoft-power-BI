Power BI is a suite of business analytics tools developed by Microsoft to analyze data and share insights. It transforms raw data of Indian companies analysis into interactive dashboards and Business Intelligence reports.
In this project, I have analyzed the growth of Indian companies from 1863 to 2019, identifying significant expansion by company ID and company names.
 Examined the distribution of company statuses, noting a majority of active companies alongside a substantial number of dissolved or inactive companies.
Analyzed 17 principal business activities, highlighting dominant sectors such as manufacturing, real estate, and financial intermediation, and identifying growth in sectors like health and social work.
Company categories include company limited by shares, company limited by guarantee, and unlimited company.
Company classes are categorized as private, public, and private (one person only).
Company subcategories consist of non-government company, subsidiary of foreign company, guarantee and association companies, state government company, and union government company.
Investigated the uneven distribution of companies across states, with economic hubs like Maharashtra, Delhi, and Karnataka hosting the majority of businesses, revealing regional disparities and dates of companies registration.
Analyzed annual and financial return dates to identify compliance trends and administrative behaviors, noting majority of companies return dates.
Examined trends in authorized and paid-up capital, identifying periods of financial growth and capital infusion aligned with favorable economic policies.

IMPLEMENTATION:
Used Python and SQL queries to extract historical data on Indian companies from databases.
Cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) and MS-Excel to handle missing values, normalize data formats, and merge datasets.
Conducted Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) with Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to uncover patterns and trends in company growth, status, categories, and business activities.
 Defined key metrics and measures using Python and Excel to create calculated fields and aggregate data for deeper insights.
Created interactive visualizations using Microsoft Power BI and Python to represent data through pie charts, bar charts, and line graphs, drawing meaningful insights and trends.
Developed user-friendly, interactive dashboards in Power BI to provide stakeholders with actionable insights and a holistic view of the data.
By using forecasting models predicting company growth of 10522 from 2020 to 2029 with 95% accuracy, visualizing future trends.
